Improvements in the performance and availability of commercial instrumentation have made ion mobility – mass spectrometry (IM-MS) an increasingly popular approach for the structural analysis of ionic species as well as for separation of complex mixtures. Here, a new research instrument is presented which enables complex experiments, extending the current scope of IM technology. The instrument is based on a Waters SYNAPT G2-Si IM-MS platform, with the IM separation region modified to accept a cyclic ion mobility (cIM) device. The cIM region consists of a 98 cm path length, closed-loop travelling wave (TW)-enabled IM separator positioned orthogonally to the main ion optical axis. A key part of this geometry and its flexibility is the interface between the ion optical axis and the cIM, where a planar array of electrodes provides control over the TW direction and subsequent ion motion. On either side of the array, there are ion guides used for injection, ejection, storage and activation of ions. In addition to single and multi-pass separations around the cIM, providing selectable mobility resolution, the instrument design and control software enable a range of ‘multi-function’ experiments such as: mobility selection, activation, storage, IMSn and importantly, custom combinations of these functions. Here the design and performance of the cIM-MS instrument is highlighted, with mobility resolving power around 750 demonstrated for 100 passes around the cIM device using an inverse sequence peptide pair. The multi-function capabilities are demonstrated through analysis of three isomeric pentasaccharide species and the small protein ubiquitin.
